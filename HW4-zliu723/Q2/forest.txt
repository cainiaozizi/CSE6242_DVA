1. What is the main reason to use a random forest versus a decision tree? (<= 50 words)
Random forest can help minimize errors caused by bias and variance. It can also help reduce overfitting.
2. How long did your random forest take to run? (in seconds)
Execution time: 0:00:04.624587
3. What accuracy (to two decimal places, xx.xx%) were you able to obtain?
accuracy:73.66%
